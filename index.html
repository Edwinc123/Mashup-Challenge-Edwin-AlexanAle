<h1>My Pets</h1> <!-- added h1 to for the title of the paragrapgh-->
    
<p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p> <!-- addded the <p> to the paragraph-->

<h2>Hamster

Fish </h2>
<img src="Fish.jpg" alt="Hamster"> <!-- added the image of the fish-->
<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p> <!-- addded the <p> to the paragraph-->
